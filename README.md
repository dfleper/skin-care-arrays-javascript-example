# JavaScript Array Example

It's just that. A simple example on how to work with Arrays in JavaScript.

IMPORTANT: This project has no CSS. It's just a barebone example on how to work with arrays in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Just create a new folder called "skin-care" for instance, and clone this project:

````
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/skin-care-arrays-javascript-example.git
````

It's also important that you use the visual studio code plugin called "Live Server". Once you have installed this plugin, right click on index.html and left click on "Open with Live Server".

Enjoy!!!
